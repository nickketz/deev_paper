  doi = {10.3389/fncir.2012.00022},
  abstract = {Divisive normalization models of covert attention commonly use spike rate modulations as indicators of the effect of top-down attention. In addition, an increasing number of studies have shown that top-down attention increases the synchronization of neuronal oscillations as well, particularly in gamma-band frequencies (25\textendash{}100 Hz). Although modulations of spike rate and synchronous oscillations are not mutually exclusive as mechanisms of attention, there has thus far been little effort to integrate these concepts into a single framework of attention. Here, we aim to provide such a unified framework by expanding the normalization model of attention with a multi-level hierarchical structure and a time dimension; allowing the simulation of a recently reported backward progression of attentional effects along the visual cortical hierarchy. A simple cascade of normalization models simulating different cortical areas is shown to cause signal degradation and a loss of stimulus discriminability over time. To negate this degradation and ensure stable neuronal stimulus representations, we incorporate a kind of oscillatory phase entrainment into our model that has previously been proposed as the ``communication-through-coherence'' (CTC) hypothesis. Our analysis shows that divisive normalization and oscillation models can complement each other in a unified account of the neural mechanisms of selective visual attention. The resulting hierarchical normalization and oscillation (HNO) model reproduces several additional spatial and temporal aspects of attentional modulation and predicts a latency effect on neuronal responses as a result of cued attention.},

  doi = {10.1037/a0033626},
  abstract = {The hippocampus is thought to be an associative memory "convergence zone," binding together the multimodal elements of an experienced event into a single engram. This predicts a degree of dependency between the retrieval of the different elements comprising an event. We present data from a series of studies designed to address this prediction. Participants vividly imagined a series of person-location-object events, and memory for these events was assessed across multiple trials of cued retrieval. Consistent with the prediction, a significant level of dependency was found between the retrieval of different elements from the same event. Furthermore, the level of dependency was sensitive both to retrieval task, with higher dependency during cued recall than cued recognition, and to subjective confidence. We propose a simple model, in which events are stored as multiple pairwise associations between individual event elements, and dependency is captured by a common factor that varies across events. This factor may relate to between-events modulation of the strength of encoding, or to a process of within-event "pattern completion" at retrieval. The model predicts the quantitative pattern of dependency in the data when changes in the level of guessing with retrieval task and confidence are taken into account. Thus, we find direct behavioral support for the idea that memory for complex multimodal events depends on the pairwise associations of their constituent elements and that retrieval of the various elements corresponding to the same event reflects a common factor that varies from event to event.},

Here we provide evidence that the hippocampus binds together the diverse elements forming an event, allowing holistic recollection via pattern completion of all elements. Participants learn complex 'events' from multiple overlapping pairs of elements, and are tested on all pairwise associations. At encoding, element 'types' (locations, people and objects/animals) produce activation in distinct neocortical regions, while hippocampal activity predicts memory performance for all within-event pairs. When retrieving a pairwise association, neocortical activity corresponding to all event elements is reinstated, including those incidental to the task. Participant's degree of incidental reinstatement correlates with their hippocampal activity. Our results suggest that event elements, represented in distinct neocortical regions, are bound into coherent 'event engrams' in the hippocampus that enable episodic recollection-the re-experiencing or holistic retrieval of all aspects of an event-via a process of hippocampal pattern completion and neocortical reinstatement.},

These events are thought to be stored in episodic memory as coherent representations [1] that allow the retrieval of all elements from a partial cue ("pattern completion" [2-6]). However, direct evidence for coherent multielement representations is lacking. Their presence would predict that retrieval of one element from an event should be dependent on retrieval of the other elements from that event. If we remember where we were, we should be more likely to remember who we met and what object they gave us. Here we provide evidence for this type of dependency in remembering three-element events. Dependency was seen when all three elements were encoded simultaneously, or when the three overlapping pairwise associations comprising an event were learned on separate trials. However, dependency was only seen in the separated encoding condition when all possible within-event associations were encoded. These results suggest that episodic memories are stored as coherent representations in which associations between all within-event elements allow retrieval via pattern completion. They also show that related experiences encountered at different times can be flexibly integrated into these coherent representations.},

  abstract = {We describe a unique conductance-based model of awake thalamic alpha and some of its implications for function. The full model includes a model for a specialized class of high-threshold thalamocortical cells (HTC cells), which burst at the alpha frequency at depolarized membrane potentials ({$\sim{}-$}56 mV). Our model generates alpha activity when the actions of either muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) or metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) agonists on thalamic reticular (RE), thalamocortical (TC), and HTC cells are mimicked. In our model of mGluR1-induced alpha, TC cells are equally likely to fire during any phase of alpha, consistent with in vitro experiments. By contrast, in our model of mAChR-induced alpha, TC cells tend to fire either at the peak or the trough of alpha, depending on conditions. Our modeling suggests that low levels of mGluR1 activation on a background of mAChR agonists may be able to initiate alpha activity that biases TC cells to fire at certain phases of alpha, offering a pathway for cortical control. If we introduce a strong stimulus by increasing the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to TC cells, an increase in alpha power is needed to mimic the level of phasing of TC cells observed in vivo. This increased alpha power reduces the probability that TC cells spike near the trough of alpha. We suggest that mAChR-induced alpha may contribute to grouping TC activity into discrete perceptual units for processing, whereas mGluR1-induced alpha may serve the purpose of blocking unwanted stimuli from reaching the cortex.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive, novel framework for understanding how the neocortex, including the thalamocortical loops through the deep layers, can support a temporal context representation in the service of predictive learning. Many have argued that predictive learning provides a compelling, powerful source of learning signals to drive the development of human intelligence: if we constantly predict what will happen next, and learn based on the discrepancies from our predictions (error-driven learning), then we can learn to improve our predictions by developing internal representations that capture the regularities of the environment (e.g., physical laws governing the time-evolution of object motions). Our version of this idea builds upon existing work with simple recurrent networks (SRN's), which have a discretely-updated temporal context representations that are a direct copy of the prior internal state representation. We argue that this discretization of temporal context updating has a number of important computational and functional advantages, and further show how the strong alpha-frequency (10hz, 100ms cycle time) oscillations in the posterior neocortex could reflect this temporal context updating. We examine a wide range of data from biology to behavior through the lens of this LeabraTI model, and find that it provides a unified account of a number of otherwise disconnected findings, all of which converge to support this new model of neocortical learning and processing. We describe an implemented model showing how predictive learning of tumbling object trajectories can facilitate object recognition with cluttered backgrounds.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates.

  volume = {250},
  issn = {1872-678X},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.02.025},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic data are easily contaminated by signals of non-neural origin. Independent component analysis (ICA) can help correct EEG data for such artifacts. Artifact independent components (ICs) can be identified by experts via visual inspection. But artifact features are sometimes ambiguous or difficult to notice, and even experts may disagree about how to categorise a particular component. It is therefore important to inform users on artifact properties, and give them the opportunity to intervene.
NEW METHOD: Here we first describe artifacts captured by ICA. We review current methods to automatically select artifactual components for rejection, and introduce the SASICA software, implementing several novel selection algorithms as well as two previously described automated methods (ADJUST, Mognon et al. Psychophysiology 2011;48(2):229; and FASTER, Nolan et al. J Neurosci Methods 2010;48(1):152).
RESULTS: We evaluate these algorithms by comparing selections suggested by SASICA and other methods to manual rejections by experts. The results show that these methods can inform observers to improve rejections. However, no automated method can accurately isolate artifacts without supervision. The comprehensive and interactive plots produced by SASICA therefore constitute a helpful guide for human users for making final decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: Rejecting ICs before EEG data analysis unavoidably requires some level of supervision. SASICA offers observers detailed information to guide selection of artifact ICs. Because it uses quantitative parameters and thresholds, it improves objectivity and reproducibility in reporting pre-processing procedures. SASICA is also a didactic tool that allows users to quickly understand what signal features captured by ICs make them likely to reflect artifacts.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004352},
  abstract = {Oscillations are ubiquitous phenomena in the animal and human brain. Among them, the alpha rhythm in human EEG is one of the most prominent examples. However, its precise mechanisms of generation are still poorly understood. It was mainly this lack of knowledge that motivated a number of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) \textendash{} functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. This approach revealed how oscillatory neuronal signatures such as the alpha rhythm are paralleled by changes of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Several such studies revealed a negative correlation between the alpha rhythm and the hemodynamic BOLD signal in visual cortex and a positive correlation in the thalamus. In this study we explore the potential generative mechanisms that lead to those observations. We use a bursting capable Stefanescu-Jirsa 3D (SJ3D) neural-mass model that reproduces a wide repertoire of prominent features of local neuronal-population dynamics. We construct a thalamo-cortical network of coupled SJ3D nodes considering excitatory and inhibitory directed connections. The model suggests that an inverse correlation between cortical multi-unit activity, i.e. the firing of neuronal populations, and narrow band local field potential oscillations in the alpha band underlies the empirically observed negative correlation between alpha-rhythm power and fMRI signal in visual cortex. Furthermore the model suggests that the interplay between tonic and bursting mode in thalamus and cortex is critical for this relation. This demonstrates how biophysically meaningful modelling can generate precise and testable hypotheses about the underpinnings of large-scale neuroimaging signals.},
